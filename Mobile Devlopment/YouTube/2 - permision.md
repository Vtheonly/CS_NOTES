Certainly! In the AndroidManifest.xml file, you can include permissions using the `<uses-permission>` tag. Here's an example:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

In this example, two common permissions are requested:
- `INTERNET`: Allows the app to access the internet.
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: Allows the app to check the network state.

You can add these lines in the `<manifest>` section of your AndroidManifest.xml file. Adjust the permissions based on the specific requirements of your app.

Feel free to let me know if you have more specific questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with!
