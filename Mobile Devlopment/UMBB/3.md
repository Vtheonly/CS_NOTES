This passage describes the initial stage of the application layers in Android:

**Applications:**
- Android comes with a set of core programs known as native applications. These applications provide access to various functionalities such as emails, SMS, calendar, photos, and web browsing.
- These applications are developed using the Java programming language.
- For the end user, the applications represent the only visible and accessible layer. They interact with these applications directly, forming the primary interface with the Android system.
