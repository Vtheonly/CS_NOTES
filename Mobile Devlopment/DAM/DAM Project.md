## Project Overview:

The primary objective of this project is to develop an Android application with robust functionalities, focusing on efficient contact management. The application will incorporate the following key features:

- **Contact Profile Management:** Enable users to create, update, delete, and read contact profiles using the SQLite library, ensuring seamless data manipulation.

- **Integrated Calling Feature:** Seamlessly initiate calls to contacts directly within the native phone application. This integration optimizes user experience by automatically copying and pasting contact numbers into the dial pad upon selection.

- **Communication Capabilities:** Facilitate communication by providing functionalities to send emails and SMS messages, by automatically copying and pasting contact emails enhancing the application's utility and versatility.

## Application Structure:

- The application is structured into two primary sections, each serving distinct purposes:

### 1. Insertion Part:

- This section enables users to add new contacts and input essential credentials such as email addresses, phone numbers, and names. Additionally, users have the option to associate a photo from their device gallery with each contact profile.

### 2. Viewing Part:

- In this section, users can access and manage the contact database they've created. They can browse through the list of contacts, search for specific contacts by name, and view associated photos. Upon selecting a contact, users are presented with a menu of available actions, including modifying contact attributes, initiating phone calls, sending SMS messages, and composing emails.

## Navigation:
