Yes, a `char**` in C or C++ is often used to represent a matrix of strings, or in other words, an array of strings. Each element of the `char**` is a pointer to a character array (C-style string), forming a two-dimensional array of characters.

Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const char* matrix[3] = {"Hello", "World", "!"};

    // Using a char** to represent a matrix of strings
    char** matrixPointer = new char*[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        matrixPointer[i] = const_cast<char*>(matrix[i]);
    }

    // Accessing and printing the strings
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        std::cout << matrixPointer[i] << std::endl;
    }

    // Don't forget to free the allocated memory
    delete[] matrixPointer;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `matrix` is an array of pointers to constant characters (`const char*`). It represents an array of strings.

- `matrixPointer` is a `char**` created using dynamic memory allocation (`new char*[3]`). Each element of this array is a pointer to a character array.

- The loop assigns each element of `matrix` to the corresponding element in `matrixPointer`.

- The strings are then printed by accessing them through `matrixPointer`.

- Finally, the dynamically allocated memory for `matrixPointer` is freed using `delete[]`.

Note: While the above example shows the mechanics of using a `char**` for a matrix of strings, in modern C++, you would typically use higher-level abstractions like `std::vector<std::string>` or a 2D `std::vector<char>` for better safety, flexibility, and ease of use.
