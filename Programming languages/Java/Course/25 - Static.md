### What Does `static` Mean in Methods in Java?

In Java, the `static` keyword is used to define a method or variable that belongs to the class itself rather than to instances (objects) of the class. When a method or variable is declared as `static`, it can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

### How Does It Affect Variables and Methods?

1. **Static Variables:**
   - A static variable is a class-level variable, and there is only one copy of it that is shared among all instances of the class. It is declared using the `static` keyword.
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       static int staticVariable = 42;

       // Other non-static variables and methods...
   }
   ```

2. **Static Methods:**
   - A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to instances of the class. It can be called directly on the class itself without creating an instance.
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       static void staticMethod() {
           // Code for the static method
       }

       // Other non-static methods...
   }
   ```

### Calling from a Static Method to a Non-Static Method:

- A static method can directly call another static method or access a static variable without the need for an instance of the class.

- However, a static method cannot directly call a non-static (instance) method or access a non-static variable. To do so, it needs an instance of the class.

### What Happens If You Don't Apply `static`?

If you don't apply the `static` keyword:
```python
print
```

1. **For Variables:**
   - Without `static`, each instance of the class gets its own copy of the variable. Changes to one instance's variable do not affect other instances.
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       int nonStaticVariable = 42;
   }
   ```

2. **For Methods:**
   - Without `static`, each instance of the class gets its own copy of the method. You need to create an instance of the class to call the method.
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       void nonStaticMethod() {
           // Code for the non-static method
       }
   }
   ```

In summary, the use of `static` in methods and variables has implications for how they are shared among instances of the class and whether they can be accessed without creating an instance. If you apply `static`, the method or variable is shared among all instances; otherwise, it is specific to each instance.
