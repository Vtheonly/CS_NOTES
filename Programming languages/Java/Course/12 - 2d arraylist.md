Sure, let's clarify the syntax and differences between 1D and 2D ArrayLists in Java.

### 1. Syntax for 1D ArrayList:

```java
ArrayList<Type> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

- `Type`: The type of elements that the ArrayList will store.

### 2. Syntax for 2D ArrayList:

```java
ArrayList<ArrayList<Type>> list2D = new ArrayList<>();
```

- `Type`: The type of elements that the inner ArrayLists will store.

### Example:

```java
// 1D ArrayList
ArrayList<Integer> numbers1D = new ArrayList<>();
numbers1D.add(1);
numbers1D.add(2);
numbers1D.add(3);

// 2D ArrayList
ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> numbers2D = new ArrayList<>();
numbers2D.add(numbers1D);  // Adding a 1D ArrayList to the 2D ArrayList
```

### Difference in Instantiating a 2D ArrayList:

In your example:

```java
ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> X = new ArrayList<>();
```

- The outer `ArrayList` is parameterized with `ArrayList<String>`, meaning it's an ArrayList that will contain other ArrayLists of Strings.

- You don't have to explicitly specify the type parameter `<String>` for the inner ArrayList when initializing. This is because of type inference, and it makes the code more concise.

### Why Get Rid of `<>' in Instantiating 2D ArrayList:

In Java 7 and later, type inference allows you to omit the generic type parameters on the right side of the assignment when it's clear from the left side. This makes the code cleaner and less verbose.

So, instead of:

```java
ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> X = new ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>();
```

You can write:

```java
ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> X = new ArrayList<>();
```

Both versions are equivalent, but the latter is considered more modern and is widely adopted for its brevity.
