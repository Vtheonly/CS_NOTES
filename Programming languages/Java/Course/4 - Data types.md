In Java, reference data types must be in capital because they are case-sensitive identifiers, and by convention, class names, which include reference data types, begin with a capital letter. This helps distinguish them from variables and other identifiers.

As for data types starting with a capital letter, this is part of the naming convention in Java. Primitive data types in Java, like int, char, and boolean, start with a lowercase letter. On the other hand, reference data types, which are usually classes, begin with an uppercase letter. This convention aids in code readability and makes it clear what type of identifier you are working with.

1. **Reference Data Types in Capital:**
   In Java, when you define a class (a reference data type), it conventionally starts with an uppercase letter. For example:

    ```java
    // Reference data type (class) with an uppercase letter
    class MyClass {
        // class definition
    }

    // Creating an object of the class
    MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
    ```

2. **Primitive Data Types vs. Reference Data Types:**
   In Java, primitive data types like `int`, `char`, and `boolean` start with lowercase letters, while reference data types (classes) start with uppercase letters:

    ```java
    // Primitive data type
    int myNumber = 42;

    // Reference data type (class)
    String myString = "Hello, Java!";
    ```

   In the above example, `int` is a primitive data type, and `String` is a reference data type.

These examples showcase the convention of using uppercase letters for class names (reference data types) and lowercase letters for primitive data types. This convention helps improve code readability and maintainability.
