In Java, strings are treated as objects rather than arrays of characters. While strings have methods for various operations, you cannot access individual characters in a string using array notation as you would with arrays. Instead, you use the `charAt` method to retrieve a specific character at a given index.

Here's an example:

```java
String A = "word";
char firstCharacter = A.charAt(0);
System.out.println("The first character is: " + firstCharacter);
```

This code uses the `charAt` method to retrieve the character at index 0 in the string and then prints it. The output would be:

```
The first character is: w
```

If you want to treat a string like an array and access individual characters, you can use the `charAt` method in a loop:

```java
String A = "word";

// Accessing characters in a loop
for (int i = 0; i < A.length(); i++) {
    char currentChar = A.charAt(i);
    System.out.println("Character at index " + i + ": " + currentChar);
}
```

This loop iterates through each character in the string and prints its index along with the character itself.

When it comes to manipulating strings, Java provides various methods in the `String` class. Here are some common operations:

- **Concatenation:**
  ```java
  String B = " Java";
  String concatenated = A + B; // "word Java"
  ```

- **Substring:**
  ```java
  String substring = A.substring(1, 3); // "or"
  ```

- **Length:**
  ```java
  int length = A.length(); // 4
  ```

- **Conversion:**
  ```java
  int number = Integer.parseInt("123"); // Convert string to int
  String str = String.valueOf(456);    // Convert int to string
  ```

Remember that strings in Java are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, you cannot change its content. Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string. If you need to perform many modifications on a string, consider using `StringBuilder` for better performance.
