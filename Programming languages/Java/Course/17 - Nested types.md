In Java, when declaring arrays, the use of square brackets `[]` is essential to indicate the type of the array and its dimensionality. The syntax is as follows:

- For a one-dimensional array: `Type[] arrayName;`
- For a two-dimensional array: `Type[][] arrayName;`

So, when you write `String[] A` or `String[][] B`, you are specifying that `A` is a one-dimensional array of strings, and `B` is a two-dimensional array of strings.

Now, let's look at your example:

```java
String[] A = {'x','y','z'};
String[][] B = {{'x','y','z'},
                {'x','y','z'},
                {'x','y','z'}};
```

In the case of `String[] A`, you are declaring a one-dimensional array of strings (`String`) with the name `A`. The array is one-dimensional, so you use one set of square brackets.

In the case of `String[][] B`, you are declaring a two-dimensional array of strings (`String`). The array is two-dimensional, so you use two sets of square brackets.

However, the inner arrays in your initialization for `B` are character arrays (`{'x','y','z'}`). If you want to create a two-dimensional array of strings, you should use double quotes for each character to represent strings:

```java
String[][] B = {{"x", "y", "z"},
                {"x", "y", "z"},
                {"x", "y", "z"}};
```

In Java, single quotes (`'`) are used for characters, and double quotes (`"`) are used for strings. The corrected code represents a two-dimensional array of strings.

In summary, the use of square brackets is crucial for defining the type and dimensionality of arrays in Java. Whether you are working with one-dimensional or multi-dimensional arrays, the square brackets help specify the array's structure and type.
