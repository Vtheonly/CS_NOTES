#### Procedural Programming:
1. **Fundamental Approach:**

   - Procedural programming, known in languages like Pascal and C, considers programs as a set of procedures acting on data.

   - Procedures are active and important, while data is passive, acting as streams of information.

2. **Program Design:**

   - Design close to Von Neuman machines, treating data and algorithms independently.

   - Introduction of modularity in top-down structured programming with autonomous abstract machines having their data structures.

  

3. **Modularity:**

   - Introduction of modularity in top-down structured programming with autonomous abstract machines having their data structures.

  

#### Object-Oriented Programming:

  

1. **Foundations:**

   - Based on the understanding of a single category of basic computer entity called an object.

   - Bottom-up design based on "messages" exchanged by objects.

  

2. **Objects and Data:**

   - Predominance of data in an object.

   - Initial question is "what are we talking about?" rather than "what do we want to do?" as in procedural programming.

  

3. **Data-Centric Approach:**

   - Data-centric with strong coupling with their function.

   - Everything revolves around "objects" representing sets of data with their properties.

  

### Comparison:

  

- **Procedural Programming:**

  - Centered on procedures (operations).

  - Weak coupling between procedures and data.

  - Algorithmic view close to machine language.

  - Maintenance is difficult, tendency to generate "spaghetti code."

  - Lack of modularity and abstraction.

  - Complex reuse, challenging teamwork.

  

- **Object-Oriented Programming:**

  - Data-centric with a strong coupling with their function.

  - Everything revolves around "objects" representing sets of data with their properties.

  - Combination of variables and processes in a single entity (object).

  - Bottom-up approach based on messages exchanged by objects.

  

In summary, object-oriented programming distinguishes itself by its focus on data, strong coupling between data and function, and the use of objects as fundamental entities, offering a more intuitive approach for designing complex software. In contrast, procedural programming is more centered on operations, with an algorithmic structure close to machine language but can become complex and less modular in complex contexts.

  
  
  
  

The description of an object is called an object class. It is practical to conceive a blueprint (a mold) of an object and to produce objects from this blueprint. In object-oriented programming (OOP), a blueprint is called a class. Therefore, the class describes the internal structure of an object (static structure + dynamic behavior), including the data it encapsulates (attributes) and the actions it can perform (methods). In a programming language, a class A introduces a new abstract type A added to the pre-defined basic types (primitives).
