Camel case is a convention widely used in Java (and many other programming languages) for naming identifiers such as variables, methods, and classes. Camel case involves writing compound words or phrases without spaces, and each word starts with a capital letter except the initial word.

For example:
- `variableName`
- `calculateTotalAmount`
- `PersonInfo`

### Reasons for Using Camel Case in Java:

1. **Readability:**
   - Camel case makes code more readable and understandable. It helps distinguish individual words within a name.

2. **Convention:**
   - Following a consistent naming convention is crucial for maintaining code consistency across projects and teams. Camel case is a widely adopted convention in the Java community.

3. **Compatibility:**
   - Camel case aligns with the conventions used in various Java libraries and frameworks. It facilitates easier integration when working with external code.

4. **Coding Standards:**
   - Many organizations and projects adopt coding standards that include the use of camel case. Consistent coding standards enhance collaboration and code maintenance.

### What Happens if You Don't Use Camel Case?

If you deviate from camel case when naming your identifiers, it doesn't necessarily cause a compilation error or a technical issue. However, there are potential drawbacks:

1. **Readability Issues:**
   - Names that do not follow camel case can be harder to read, especially as the length of names increases. This can lead to confusion and make the code less maintainable.

2. **Inconsistency:**
   - Inconsistently named variables or methods may make it difficult for others (or even yourself) to understand the code, leading to confusion and potential errors.

3. **Conventions Violation:**
   - Not adhering to widely accepted naming conventions can violate coding standards, which might be enforced by code review processes or automated tools.

### Example of Non-Camel Case:

```java
int variable_name = 42;  // Not using camel case
```

While the code above is technically correct, it is not following the widely adopted camel case convention. If you consistently use an alternative naming convention throughout your code, it can still be understood, but it may deviate from industry norms and best practices.

In conclusion, adhering to camel case in Java is a best practice that contributes to code readability, maintainability, and conformity with widely accepted coding standards. While not using camel case won't lead to errors, it may make your code less readable and less consistent with common coding practices.
