**The Three Fundamentals of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):**

### 1. Encapsulation:

**Definition:**
- Encapsulation is a mechanism that involves gathering the static aspects (data) and dynamic aspects (methods) specific to an entity within a structure, hiding the implementation details of the object (attributes + methods).
- It also involves defining the visibility level of the elements within the class.

**Purpose:**
- The primary purpose is to prevent unauthorized access to data and code by means other than the provided services, ensuring data integrity.
- It achieves this by protecting access to data and methods at three visibility levels: public, private, and protected.
- Enhances application security and facilitates maintenance.

### 2. Inheritance:

**Definition:**
- Inheritance is a mechanism where one defines an object class as a particular case of a more general class.
- This creates a hierarchical structure known as a class hierarchy.

**Purpose:**
- Enables the reuse of code and avoids the duplication of common data and methods.
- Subclasses (derived classes) inherit attributes and behaviors from a superclass (base class).
- Promotes code organization and the creation of a structured class hierarchy.

### 3. Polymorphism:

**Definition:**
- Polymorphism, derived from Greek, means "of different forms."
- It allows methods (ad-hoc polymorphism) and/or attributes (parametric polymorphism) with the same name and similar functionalities to exist in different classes.

**Purpose:**
- Redefines certain methods inherited from the parent class in a derived class.
- A single method can have multiple forms or behaviors.
- Facilitates code flexibility and extensibility.
- Supports method overloading and overriding.

**Summary:**
- **Encapsulation:** Protects data and methods, controls visibility, and enhances security.
- **Inheritance:** Creates a hierarchical structure, promotes code reuse, and avoids redundancy.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows for flexibility, multiple forms of methods, and attribute types with similar functionalities in different classes.

Together, these three principles form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and contribute to the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
