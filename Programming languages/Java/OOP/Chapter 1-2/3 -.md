**Concrete Class and Abstract Class:**

1. **Concrete Class (Classe Concr√®te):**
   - A concrete class is a class that can be instantiated or, in simpler terms, it can be used to create objects.
   - Instances (objects) of a concrete class can be created, and they can have specific values assigned to their attributes.
   - Concrete classes often encapsulate both the structure (data members) and behavior (methods) of objects.
   - These classes provide a blueprint for creating tangible, real-world objects.

2. **Abstract Class (Classe Abstraite):**
   - An abstract class is not instantiable, meaning you cannot create objects directly from it.
   - Its primary purpose is related to organization and specification rather than instantiation.
   - An abstract class may contain abstract methods, which are methods without a concrete implementation. These methods are meant to be overridden by the subclasses (concrete classes) that inherit from the abstract class.
   - Abstract classes are often used to define a common interface or set of methods that concrete subclasses must implement.
   - Abstract classes serve as a way to enforce a certain structure or behavior across a group of related classes.

**Example in Java:**

```java
// Concrete Class
class Dog {
    // Attributes and methods specific to Dog
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

// Abstract Class
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void draw();
    
    // Concrete method
    void resize() {
        System.out.println("Resizing the shape");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` is a concrete class that can be instantiated to create dog objects. On the other hand, `Shape` is an abstract class that cannot be directly instantiated. It serves as a blueprint for other classes by defining an abstract method `draw()` that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses. The `Shape` class can also have concrete methods, like `resize()`, that provide a common behavior shared by its subclasses.
